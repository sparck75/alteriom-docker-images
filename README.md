Pre-built PlatformIO builder images for the Alteriom project (ESP32 / ESP32-C3 / ESP8266).

This repository contains optimized Dockerfiles and helper scripts to build and publish minimal PlatformIO images for ESP32/ESP32-C3/ESP8266 firmware builds. The images are optimized for size while maintaining full functionality.

**Status**: Docker tag generation issue has been fixed âœ…

## Version Tracking

The repository uses an automated badge system to show current version information:

- **Production Badge**: Shows the latest stable release version from GitHub releases
- **Development Badge**: Shows the current development version with incremental build numbers
  - Format: `1.6.1+ (build N)` where N is an incremental build number starting from 1
  - Updated automatically when development images are built
  - Build numbers increment with each development build
  - Links directly to the GHCR development package

Development images are tagged with both `:latest` and versioned tags (e.g., `:1.6.1-dev-build.N`) to provide flexibility in CI/CD pipelines.

## Contents
- production/Dockerfile  â€” optimized minimal builder image with PlatformIO (ESP platforms installed at runtime)
- development/Dockerfile â€” development image with extra tools and debugging utilities  
- scripts/build-images.sh â€” build and push helper script
- scripts/verify-images.sh â€” verify published images are available and working
- OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md â€” detailed guide on image size optimizations
- FIREWALL_CONFIGURATION.md â€” network access requirements and firewall allowlist

Quick start

Pull the recommended builder image (replace `<your_user>` with the image owner):

```powershell
docker pull ghcr.io/<your_user>/alteriom-docker-images/builder:latest
```

Build firmware using the image:

```powershell
# mount your repository into /workspace and run PlatformIO inside the image
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/workspace ghcr.io/<your_user>/alteriom-docker-images/builder:latest pio run -e diag-esp32-c3
```

**Verify images are ready:**

```bash
# Check if images are published and working
./scripts/verify-images.sh

# Test ESP platform builds with Docker images
./scripts/test-esp-builds.sh
```

Build & publish (admin, one-time - run in an unrestricted network environment)

```powershell
# from the cloned Alteriom repo
# set GITHUB_TOKEN and DOCKER_REPOSITORY environment variables
./scripts/build-images.sh push
```

## Image Optimizations

The Docker images have been optimized for minimal size while maintaining full PlatformIO functionality:

**Key optimizations:**
- ESP32/ESP32-C3/ESP8266 platforms installed at runtime (smaller base image)
- Build tools removed after PlatformIO installation  
- Unnecessary packages eliminated
- Single-layer package installation for better caching

**Benefits:**
- Significantly smaller images for faster pulls
- Always get latest ESP platform versions
- Better Docker layer caching
- Same functionality and usage

See [OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md](OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed information.

## Testing and Validation

The repository includes comprehensive tests to validate Docker image functionality:

### ESP Platform Build Tests

Automated tests verify that the Docker images can successfully build firmware for all supported ESP platforms:

- **ESP32** (esp32dev environment)
- **ESP32-S3** (esp32-s3-devkitc-1 environment)  
- **ESP32-C3** (esp32-c3-devkitm-1 environment)
- **ESP8266** (nodemcuv2 environment)

**Run tests manually:**

```bash
# Test with default images (builder:latest and dev:latest)
./scripts/test-esp-builds.sh

# Test with specific image
./scripts/test-esp-builds.sh ghcr.io/sparck75/alteriom-docker-images/builder:latest

# Show help and options
./scripts/test-esp-builds.sh --help
```

**Test validation includes:**
- Docker image availability and accessibility
- PlatformIO functionality within containers
- ESP platform installation and compilation
- Arduino framework compatibility
- Successful firmware generation

The tests are automatically executed in the CI/CD pipeline after images are built, ensuring published images are fully functional.

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for detailed testing information.

## CI / Automated builds

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build-and-publish.yml`) that automatically builds and publishes Docker images with different strategies based on the trigger type.

**ðŸŒ… Daily Builds (Optimized):** 
- **Schedule**: Daily at 02:00 UTC, but **only builds the development image**
- **Development versions**: Tagged with format `1.6.1-dev-build.N` for incremental build tracking
- **Version badge**: Automatically updated to show current development version (e.g., "1.6.1+ (build 2)")
- **Cost optimization**: Reduces CI/CD resource usage by ~50% while maintaining development image freshness
- **Production unchanged**: Stable production images remain unchanged during daily builds

**ðŸš€ Production Builds:**
- **PR merges**: Full builds of both production and development images with version increments
- **Manual dispatch**: Complete builds available via GitHub Actions interface
- **Automated versioning**: Semantic version bumping based on commit message conventions

**ðŸ§ª Automated testing:** After successful image builds, the workflow automatically runs ESP platform build tests to validate that the published images are fully functional for ESP32, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3, and ESP8266 development. 

**Setup required:** The workflow is pre-configured to use GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) and requires no additional secrets setup. The workflow uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication.

**Versioning Guide:** See [AUTOMATED_VERSIONING.md](AUTOMATED_VERSIONING.md) for complete instructions on using the automated version management system.

**Admin Notes:** 
- Repository has been tested and builds are working as of August 2025
- Docker builds use Python 3.11-slim base image (compatible with current package repositories)
- Both production and development images build successfully with multi-platform support

**Optional configuration:** If you want to use a different container registry, set the following repository variables:

- `DOCKER_REPOSITORY` - target repository (e.g. `ghcr.io/<your_user>/alteriom-docker-images`) - optional, defaults to `ghcr.io/<owner>/alteriom-docker-images`

The workflow runs:
- **Daily builds** at 02:00 UTC (development image only - cost optimized)
- **Production builds** when PRs are merged to the main branch (both images)
- **Manual builds** via workflow dispatch in the Actions tab (both images)

Contribution and maintenance

If you'd like me to help maintain the CI and update images regularly, I can:

- Review and refine the Dockerfiles for size and reproducibility
- Add automated smoke tests that run a quick `pio run -e diag-esp32-c3` inside the image
- Keep the daily build workflow and perform periodic reviews when PlatformIO releases major changes
